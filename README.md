# banter
A private chat system for Garry's Mod, a physics sandbox game.

## What is it?

_banter_ is a self-contained Wiremod Expression 2 program that lets you seamlessly communicate with other players in the game without needing any external applications.

## Okay, but how do I get it?
If you have Git installed, you may clone the repository using your command line of choice:

`git clone https://github.com/ericweitzel/banter`

Alternatively, you may download the repository as a compressed archive and decompress it later.
## I downloaded _banter_. How do I install it?
The best way to do this is to place __banter.txt__ in the following folder:

`Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\data\expression2`

_Note: If you are not running a 64-bit edition of Windows, simply omit " (x86)" from the path._

## I installed _banter_. How do I use it?
_Note: I can assume that if you are using this program, you have a working knowledge of the Expression 2 tool as well as very basic Expression 2 programming._

In-game, choose the __Expression 2__ tool from the __Wiremod__ menu, and load __banter.txt__. You may need to refresh the list. In the editor, set the __Scope__, __Group__, __NameColor__, and __Prefix__ variables to your liking. Place the Expression 2 anywhere, and you're ready to use _banter_!
